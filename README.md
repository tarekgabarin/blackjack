I wrote the documentation here as though it were to be read by another programmer who has been tasked with maintaining this codebase. 

## Tools Used To Build This Project

This project was built using React. I set up the project using a build-tool called [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For CSS, I used a framework called [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/). Unlike other frameworks, Tachyons does not come with pre-built UI components. Instead, Tachyons is a functional CSS framework, meaning that it provides developers with a plethora of utility classes that they can use to easily create their custom UI components. 

## Folder Structure

The `src` folder is divided into the following five sub-folders:

### `assets`

Nested within the `assets` folder, are two subfolders, `images` and `css`. As its name would suggest,  the `images`subfolder contains image files. 

The `css` subfolder contains a minified CSS file called `tachyons.min.css`. This file contains a minified version of Tachyon’s source code; it is strongly recommended that you avoid editing this file. It is placed in the `assets` folder so as to make it less likely that another developer mistakenly edits it.    
 

### `components`

The `component` folder is where presentational components for UI elements are placed. Such components contain no business logic and no state, and are meant solely for stylizing and organizing UI. 


### `css`

Next is the `css` folder, it contains a single file called `app.css`. This file is used to import other stylesheets and write global CSS classes. 

There is a table of contents I added to organize custom css classes by their function; It is strongly recommend that you write your css classes under the category they are suited for, as it greatly helps with organization.

To avoid class name conflicts, please make sure that you don’t give your custom classes the same name as one of the utility classes in Tachyons. You can find a list of all Tachyon’s utility classes [here for reference](https://tachyons.io/docs/table-of-styles/).

### `pages`

Then there is the `pages` folder. This is where the container components in the project are located. Container components are components that manage state and lifecycle methods, handle business logic, and render an entire web page.

### `utils`

Lastly there is the `utils` folder. This houses code for fetching API calls as well as helper functions that are reusable across multiple components. 

Within the `src` directory itself, there are individual files. 

The `App.js` file is where navigation is handled. The library used to handle navigation is `react-router-dom`. You can find the [documentation for it here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start).

As its name would suggest, `App.test.js`is for writing test code. The testing framework used in this codebase is Jest. You can read more about it [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

This is the end of all the documentation written by me for this code base. The following material is from the standard `README.md` you would find generated by `create-react-app`. I have kept it here just in case.

#Create React App 

In the project directory, you can run:

## Commands



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
